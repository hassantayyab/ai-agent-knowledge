# Retrieval-first policy for this repo

## Goal

Answer using the smallest subset of chapters.

## Process (must follow)

1. Read `INDEX.md` first.
2. Select at most **2** chapter files from `/principles/chapters` and/or `/patterns/chapters`.
3. Open only those chapter files.
4. If still insufficient, add **1** more chapter and repeat.

## Output requirements

- State which chapters were used.
- Cite chapter + section heading in the answer.
- Prefer reusing chapter code blocks over inventing new code.

## Anti-patterns

- Do NOT load all chapters.
- Do NOT summarize the whole library unless explicitly asked.
