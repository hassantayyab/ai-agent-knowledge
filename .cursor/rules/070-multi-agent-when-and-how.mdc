# Multi-agent usage

Only recommend multi-agent if:

- tasks can be parallelized
- specialization clearly improves quality
- you can verify/merge deterministically

Default pattern:

- supervisor delegates to workers
- workers return schema outputs with evidence + unknowns
- supervisor reconciles conflicts and validates.
