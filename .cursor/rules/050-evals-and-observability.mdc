# Evals + observability

When proposing changes to agent behavior:

- define success criteria
- propose a small eval set (20–50 real cases)
- prefer structured scoring (schemas/tool correctness)
- use traces to debug failures (where retrieval/tool calls went wrong)

If RAG:

- score retrieval separately from generation faithfulness.
