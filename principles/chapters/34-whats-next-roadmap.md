# What’s next: building your agent roadmap (Chapter 34)

## Summary

A pragmatic progression:

1. single agent with tools
2. workflows for reliability
3. observability + eval gates
4. RAG if knowledge is the blocker
5. curated memory for continuity
6. multi-agent only when specialization is clearly needed

## Roadmap (recommended order)

- **v1 agent**: narrow scope, tool grounding, structured outputs (Ch 29)
- **workflows**: decomposition, checkpoints, streaming (Ch 12–15)
- **observability + evals**: tracing + regression gates (Ch 16, 25–27)
- **RAG**: pipeline + eval retrieval vs faithfulness (Ch 17–19, 26)
- **memory**: curated + separated from state (Ch 31–32)
- **multi-agent**: supervisor + schemas + workflow control (Ch 21–24)

## Practical takeaways

- Complexity must earn its keep (prove with evals).
- Put security in middleware, not only prompts (Ch 9, 30).
