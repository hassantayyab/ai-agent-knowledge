# Memory 101: what to remember, where to store it, and when to retrieve (Chapter 31)

## Summary

- Memory is about persisting useful information across turns/sessions.
- Good memory is selective:
  - store stable preferences and long-lived facts
  - avoid sensitive or ephemeral details
- Three layers:
  1. short-term context
  2. working memory (run state)
  3. long-term memory (profile/notes/vector)

## Core concepts

### What to store

Store:

- preferences (format, tone)
- stable facts (timezone, role)
- long-lived goals/constraints

Avoid:

- secrets and credentials
- sensitive identifiers
- transient one-offs

### Retrieval strategies

- trigger/intent-based
- similarity-based (embeddings)
- hybrid + recency

## Practical takeaways

- Memory should be small, high-signal, and user-controllable.
- Treat retrieval quality as an eval target (similar to RAG).
